# DataScienceGUI

DataScienceGUI is a Python GUI designed to simplify data science analysis and machine learning by allowing the user to conveniently open/change CSV file, select feature columns/label from CSV file, select machine learning algorithm from Scikit-Learn or Sequential Model from Keras/Tensorflow (removed in new version due to complications of setting up Keras/Tensorflow), and tune parameters before training the model. In addition, it allows you to play around with the model with user-inputted values.
